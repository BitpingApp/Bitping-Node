# Bitping Node (Public Beta)

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Auto-updates**: No need to manually check and install updates. The Bitping Node will download an update, check the signature and then auto install itself, meaning maintenance of your node is hands off.
- **New P2P network**: The new Bitping node utilises our new custom, P2P network built on top of the LibP2P framework.
- **Two versions available**:
  - **Bitping Desktop**: A user-friendly graphical interface for your desktop or laptop.
  - **bitpingd (for CLI)**: A robust and clear command-line interface for servers.
- **CalVer Versioning**: The versioning system follows the Calendar Versioning format (YY.M.DD-buildnumber).
- **Lower resource usage**: Compared to the old node, the new Bitpingd Node is more efficient and consumes fewer resources.
- **Clearer CLI flags**: `bitpingd` now has a more organized and understandable set of CLI flags. Check them out using `bitpingd --help`.
- **Service installation**: Easily install `bitpingd` as a service with the commands `bitpingd service install && bitpingd service start`. Compatibility includes Launchd on Mac and Systemd, initd, and openrc on Linux.

> ðŸš« **Important**:
> It's not recommended to run both `bitpingd` and Bitping Desktop on the same machine as it may flag your nodes as spam in the network.
> Do not run multiple `bitpingd` or Bitping Desktop instances on the same machine when they are pointing to the same credentials directory (`~/.bitpingd`, `~/.bitping` or Docker volume)
