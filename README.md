# Bitping Node

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Auto-updates**: No need to manually check and install updates. The Bitping Node will download an update, check the signature and then auto install itself, meaning maintenance of your node is hands off.
- **New P2P network**: The new Bitping node utilises our new custom, P2P network built on top of the LibP2P framework.
- **Two versions available**:
  - **Bitping Desktop**: A user-friendly graphical interface for your desktop or laptop.
  - **bitpingd (for CLI)**: A robust and clear command-line interface for servers.
- **CalVer Versioning**: The versioning system follows the Calendar Versioning format (YY.M.DD-buildnumber).
- **Lower resource usage**: Compared to the old node, the new Bitpingd Node is more efficient and consumes fewer resources.
- **Clearer CLI flags**: `bitpingd` now has a more organized and understandable set of CLI flags. Check them out using `bitpingd --help`.
- **Service installation**: Easily install `bitpingd` as a service with the commands `bitpingd service install && bitpingd service start`. Compatibility includes Launchd on Mac and Systemd, initd, and openrc on Linux.

> ðŸš« **Important**:
> It's not recommended to run both `bitpingd` and Bitping Desktop on the same machine as it may flag your nodes as spam in the network.
> 
> Do not run multiple `bitpingd` or Bitping Desktop instances on the same machine when they are pointing to the same credentials directory (`~/.bitpingd`, `~/.bitping` or Docker volume)

## Recommendations

#### Passive Income while actively using your computer
Use Bitping Desktop on MacOS and Windows. 
Bitping Desktop does not explicitly run in the background while you are logged out of your computer.
The Idea of Bitping Desktop is to have you passively earn income while you're going about your daily activities on your computer/laptop.

#### Constant Passive Income 
Use Bitpingd on Linux.
Bitpingd is built to be run as a system daemon either via Systemd, Launchd or Docker. 
It will run in the background even while your user account is logged out.
